Systems built from ultracold molecules are promising for many applications such as precision measurements and quantum information thanks to their rich internal states and strong interaction. However, achieving full quantum control of such inherent complexity remains challenging and currently the most successful approach to overcome it relies heavily on special properties of the system. Here, we experimentally demonstrated a more general approach utilizing optical transitions to pair a sodium and a cesium atom in the same optical tweezer to form a NaCs molecule.

The full control of the molecule we create is achieved by first fully controlling the constituent atoms and then mapping this control to molecules through association. The coherence of this mapping was demonstrated by driving the atom pair to the weakly bound state back and forth. This approach has to overcome the large size mismatch between the initial free atom state and the final weakly bound state through careful selection of all the states involved (<- this previous sentence tries to describe what challenge we overcame in a succinct and simple to understand way).

Compared to similar approaches using magnetic Feshbach resonances, our method uses only optical transitions that are abundant for pairs of atoms and could allow a diverse range of molecules to be associated atom-by-atom. The molecules we create can be transferred to other states with stronger interaction to be used for quantum computation and simulation.
