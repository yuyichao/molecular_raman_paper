@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note="We choose the two beams to have equal power, which gives the highest Raman Rabi rate at a fixed total power. Thus, this results in a simple factor of 2 coming from scattering off 2 beams."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note2,key="Note2",note="There is an additional factor of 2, with both beams at equal power, to account for the Stark shift caused by both beams."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note3,key="Note3",note="This interaction shift is larger than the differential axial trapping frequency between Na and Cs atoms, which decouples the relative and center of mass motional state and improves the robustness of our preparation of the relative motion ground state."}
