@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note="The two beams have equal power to maximize the Raman Rabi rate at fixed total power, resulting in a factor of 2 for scattering two beams."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note2,key="Note2",note="There is an additional factor of 2, with both beams at equal power, to account for the Stark shift caused by both beams."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note3,key="Note3",note="See Supplementary Material"}
@FOOTNOTE{Note4,key="Note4",note="This interaction shift is larger than the differential axial trapping frequency between Na and Cs atoms, which decouples the relative and center of mass motional state and improves the robustness of our preparation of the relative motional ground state."}
